# Signature-Validation
Resources for independently validating blocknify signatures

# How to use this resource
Just go to https://blocknify.github.io/signature-validation/calculate.html and add your document. Your document and information will NOT be uploaded.

# Our Goal
The goal of providing this as an open resource is to allow any Blocknify signers to verify their documents at any time (today or 10 years from now). In October 2020, we started including all the data needed to verify a document inside the attached audit trail (emailed once all signers signed the document or downloaded it from our extension). This allows any signer at any time to verify their signature against the Stellar Blockchain with only their document and audit trail. This means that you don't need to rely on Blocknify for any additional information at any time. As you can see within our code, the only external communication is directly from the Stellar Blockchain.
